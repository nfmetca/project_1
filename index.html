Even with their high contrast weighting, the Fascinate family is cleanly legible at small sizes, although the Inline version is better visible at larger display sizes.</p>

            <p class="p1">Art Deco is an influential visual arts design style that first appeared in France just before World War I and became globally prominent in the 1920s and 1930s. It is characterized by bold geometric patterns, vibrant colors, and lavish ornamentation. The style was a departure from the flowing, organic forms of Art Nouveau, embracing a more modern and streamlined aesthetic. Art Deco was a reflection of the post-war optimism and the technological advancements of the era, blending traditional craft motifs with futuristic influences.</p>
            <p class="p2">One of the most distinctive features of Art Deco is its use of geometry. Zigzags, chevrons, sunbursts, and stylized floral patterns were common motifs, often rendered in rich materials such as chrome, glass, marble, and exotic woods. This design style was applied across a variety of mediums, from architecture to interior design, fashion, jewelry, and even automobiles. The Chrysler Building in New York, with its sleek lines and metallic ornamentation, is one of the most iconic examples of Art Deco architecture.</p>
            <p class="p3">Art Deco also embraced luxury and opulence, reflecting the growing wealth of the upper classes in the early 20th century. Materials such as gold leaf, ivory, and lacquer were frequently used, contributing to the sense of grandeur. This was especially evident in the decorative arts, with furniture, lamps, and everyday objects transformed into pieces of art. The movement took inspiration from various sources, including ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Aztec art, infusing designs with exoticism and bold, eye-catching patterns.</p>
            <p class="p4">By the 1940s, Art Deco began to fade in popularity, giving way to the more austere and functional styles of Modernism and the International Style. However, it left a lasting legacy and continues to be celebrated for its elegance, innovation, and ability to capture the spirit of its time. Today, Art Deco remains a popular design choice for interiors, graphics, and even fashion, with its bold lines and glamorous details continuing to inspire contemporary designers.</p>
